Python Processig and Analysis of CoEVP Logs
---

Much more to write here. For a quick example of how Python will be used to
analyze and process the CoEVP logs, take a look at the IPython notebook(s)
in this directory. You can click on the file and view it as if it were in a
IPython notebook interface.

More to come.
